          <p> Hello plant community! My name's Andrea, and I just wanted to share a little bit about myself. I'm currently pursuing a nursing degree,
          with my goal set on becoming a Registered Nurse. During my first sesmester of school, the stress really got to me, and I wanted to channel it somewhere.
          I came across some plant influencers on Instagram, and they were talking about how plants are actually beneficial towards someone's health. I decided to buy
          my first plant ever which was a string of turtles! Since then, nurturing, selling, and buying plants has been an extensive hobby of mine. I have met amazing
          people throughout my journey and want to share it with you! Below, you can also download the recipe for my famous "Plant Care Spray." It's our number one priority
          to nurture and raise plants the right way without neglecting them. With this spray, your plants will remain pest free and grow healthy, and I want to share it with the everyone FOR FREE.
          </p>
