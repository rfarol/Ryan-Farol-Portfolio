# Ryan-Farol-Portfolio

Hi! Welcome to Ryan Farol's portfolio. It contiains the following two projects:

CS261 Data Structures Portfolio Project — Hash Map:
- Built a hash map using a hash table of buckets with each containing a linked list of hash links. Each hash link stores the key-value pair and a pointer to the next link in the list.
- A Dynamic Array is used to store the hash table, and singly linked lists were used for collision resolution.
- Used: Python


CS290 Web Development Portfolio Project — Personal Website
= Built a static website for a demo plant shop for a personal friend that allows the user to view plants for sale. Checkout function was not implemented. 
= Utilized Javascript to make an automatic rotating picture gallery
= Used: Javascript, HTML/CSS
